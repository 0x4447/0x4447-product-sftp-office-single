# 0x4447 Basic SFTP for the Office â€“ single account


This folder `Stack_SFTP_Office` contains a CloudFormation file that, when deployed, will create a SFTP server in your selected AWS account.

The stack is ideal for anyone looking to have their own personal file server or for a small/medium office to share files between employs. Either to cut costs, or to have more control over your files.

# DISCLAIMER!

This stack is available to anyone at no cost, but on an as-is basis. 0x4447 LLC is not responsible for damages, costs or data lost of any kind that may occur when this stack is used. You take full responsibility when you use it.

# Before you deploy

Don't expect this stack to do everything for you. For example, the CF file itself can't create the Elastic IP part; you'll need to request a fixed IP and take note of the ID, which you'll use when deploying the CloudFormation file. The next section contains details on why an Elastic IP is important and how it's used.

# How to deploy

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=zer0x4447-SFTP&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/0x4447-drive-cloudformation/sftp.json">
<img align="left" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"></a>

To deploy this stack just click the button to the left (But before you do that, make sure you are subscribed to [Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XS8WHGJ)), and follow the instructions that CloudFormation provides in your AWS Dashboard. Alternatively you can download the CF file from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/0x4447-drive-cloudformation/sftp.json).

# What deploys

![0x4447 SFTP Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x4447/0x4447-product-sftp-office-single/assets/stack.png)

The image above shows the stack that deploys. The following is a detailed list of all resources the stack creates for you:

- 1x EFS
- 1x EC2
	- 1x Launch Configuration
	- 1x Auto Scaling Group
	- 1x Security Group
- 1x CloudWatch Dashboard
- 1x CloudWatch Logs
- 3x CloudWatch Alerts
  - EC2 CPU
  - EC2 CPU Burst
  - EC2 RAM

# How it works

The SFTP server is created using SSHd and automatically configured at boot time using the EC2 `user data` data section. This solution provides multifold benefits:

- The SSH foundation is solid and stable
- If the EC2 server is terminated for whatever reason, a new instance will take its place.
- Terminating the EC2 instance won't delete the data since all the files are stored on EFS, which is mounted at boot time.
- Since EFS grows with your data you'll never run out of space since the drive grows with your data automatically.

**Additional benefit**: You can purposely terminate the EC2 instance if you notice that network performance is deteriorating, which can happen when working in a shared VM environment. If this happens, terminate the instance and then wait about five minutes. Hopefully, the new EC2 Instance will be created on a different machine with hopefully less load.

This gives you a very resilient solution that's hard to break.

# Elastic IP magic

Another important aspect of this stack is that it requires an Elastic IP to work. This is important for preserving continuity. The EC2 instance automatically attaches the provided Elastic IP at boot time, meaning even if the EC2 has to be recreated because there's an issue, it will always have the same IP. This means that anyone using your SFTP server will see only a few minutes of downtime, and then everything will be restored. There's no need to update the DNS settings with a new public IP.

As you can see, once this stack is deployed, it does everything possible to ensure that all moving parts are always available.

# Best practice

The best way to take advantage of these benefits is to have a unique AWS Account for this stack alone. This should be done via the AWS Organization feature, which offers the following advantages:

- One free Elastic IP per AWS account
- Free Tree CloudWatch Dashboard for each account
- Ease of limiting access to this AWS VPN account
- More precise access to other accounts through VPC Peering

# Pricing

This stack generates expenses via three resources (if deployed in a dedicated AWS Account):

- EFS
- EC2
- Network traffic
- CloudWatch Alarms
- CloudWatch Logs

Additional charges may apply if it isn't deployed via a unique AWS Account:

- Elastic IP
- CloudWatch Dashboard

## CPU Load

Since we're using a t3.nano type server, the monthly price should be around $0.0052/h * 24/h * 30/d = $3.74 a month. Check the [AWS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) to make sure this calculation is still valid. Also, we're using a T3-type instance, so you might be charged for Burst mode if the CPU time go exceeds the average. In general, the VPN generates very little CPU load. But we're running a complex operating system, so if any process gets stuck in an endless loop or the server is somehow compromised, you should be aware that the CPU load could go way up.

## Network

The network traffic price depends on how much you use it, but here's an example to give you an idea of what to expect. If you were to transfer 100GB of data from the EC2 instance to the internet, you'd pay 100GB * $0.09/GB = $9.00. Check the [AWS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) to make sure this calculation is still valid.

## Alarms

The alarms in your account will cost ten cents apiece, and we create three of them. Check the [AWS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) to make sure this calculation is still valid.

# Monitoring

To provide you with a clear insight into the resources that are available to you, we built a detailed dashboard that graphically shows exactly what's happening in your EC2 instance and container. In addition, it will set alarms to let you know when key aspects of the deployment are acting out, and the EC2 will push logs to CloudWatch to give you a detailed view of the instance's insides without the need for SSH inside the machine.

## Dashboard

![0x4447 SFTP Stack Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x4447/0x4447-product-sftp-office-single/assets/dashboard.png)

As you can see in the image above, you'll have a clear view of what's going on with your resources. We recommend using the full-screen feature, which updates the widget as new data comes in.

## Alerts

To help you sleep better at night, we've included three CloudWatch Alerts. This ensures that you'll receive an email from AWS to inform you when the EC2 instance's CPU, CPU Burst or RAM goes above a certain threshold so you can take appropriate actions.

## Logs

We also send logs to CloudWatch to make it easy to see exactly what is going on inside the EC2 instance without the need to log in to the machine itself. We exposed the following logs:

- /var/log/messages
- /var/log/secure

# How to work with this project

When you want to deploy the stack, the only file you should be interested in is the `CloudFormation.json` file. If you'd like to modify the stack, we recommend that you use the [Grapes framework](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-cli-node-grapes), which was designed to make it easier to work with the CloudFormation file. You should never edit the main CF file if you want to keep your sanity ðŸ¤ª.
